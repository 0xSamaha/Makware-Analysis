## Basic Static Analysis :
When I opened the sample in DIE, I noticed that it is a C# application. DIE indicated that the malware is not packed, but I can see that it has high entropy. So, let's proceed with our static analysis.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/1.png)
![](analysis/images%20agaent/2.png)


Here see that description related for trusted company (VandelayHealthBenefits)

![](analysis/images%20agaent/3.png)


When you encounter these strings (A9283, A6546, A23548, A6879, AAA123) in dnspy, you should take a closer look at them.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/4.png)


The malware includes company information in its version section, likely to use it for evasion or other purposes.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/5.png)


It has many resources, but we will find out later if they are trustworthy

![](analysis/images%20agaent/6.png)


## Advanced Static Analysis :
Open the malware in Dnspy and search for the following weird strings: ``A9283``, ``A6546``, ``A23548``, ``A6879``, ``AAA123``. I noticed that the function A23548 is called from the class VandelaySplashScreen and it takes two arguments. Let's continue investigating it

![](analysis/images%20agaent/7.png)


The function ``A23548`` doesn't use its arguments, but inside it calls functions A6879, A6546, and ``GameLoop0``. This function takes a peculiar argument called ``VDObjects.MapX`` and compares the result from function GameLoop0 with empty. If it is not empty, the function ``A6879`` takes a variable (text) as an argument and passes whatever it receives from function ``A6879`` to function ``A6546`` as an argument

![](analysis/images%20agaent/8.png)


When I see the variable ``MapX`` it contains some data that appears to be encoded. It seems to replace characters like ``a`` with ``377`` for certain representations

![](analysis/images%20agaent/9.png)
![](analysis/images%20agaent/10.png)


GameLoop0 Split the input string into individual substrings using spaces as delimiters , convert each substring to a double data type , subtract 312.0 from each double value , round the result of the subtraction to the nearest integer , convert each integer to a corresponding character using the ASCII code , Concatenate these characters to form a new string and Return the resulting string .

![](analysis/images%20agaent/11.png)


Function ``A6879`` calls function ``A9283`` and receives a return value from it. This value is then decoded from Base64 and loaded into memory. The loaded assembly can be used later by the malware.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/12.png)

Pass the loaded assembly as an argument to function ``AAA123`` after converting it to an array.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/13.png)


Function AAA123 has a variable called ``array`` with three values. One of these values is a namespace (VandelayHealthBenefits). The last two values (``OOOOO.x2`` and ``OOOOO.x3``) are resources. Function ``QV`` is loaded from the data in memory and called with the "array" as an argument. Let's find out the contents of this array.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/14.png)


The OOOOO.x2 = ``meBW`` , OOOOO.x3 = ``Ysjyb`` then we know now this values 

![](analysis/images%20agaent/15.png)


In the resources, you will find a variable named ``meBW``,which is a bitmap. This bitmap can be decrypted using the key "Ysjyb," and the decrypted data will be loaded into memory

![](analysis/images%20agaent/16.png)


## Advanced Dynamic Analysis :
The data in variable ``VDObjects.MapX`` is now decoded, and it's clear that the data is in Base64 format.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/17.png)


After decoding this data, it is evident that it is stage two.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/18.png)


The decoded executable named ``Bunifu.UI`` is now loaded into memory

![](analysis/images%20agaent/19.png)
![](analysis/images%20agaent/20.png)


In this notice, the variable X uses tf.dr to call the function ``QV``. This function QV will be invoked in a new executable and will load the necessary arguments where it is needed.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/21.png)


We need to set a breakpoint in the loaded executable during the second stage, but it's obfuscated. We'll need to beautify it and load it into memory to continue our investigation

![](analysis/images%20agaent/22.png)


After using the tool de4dot to clean the executable and obtaining the clean version, there are various ways to ensure the malware loads the clean version instead of the obfuscated one. If you have programming skills, you can modify the malware code to force it to use the clean version. Alternatively, you can write a script to achieve this

![](analysis/images%20agaent/23.png)


Decoded this with Base64 Encoded 

![](analysis/images%20agaent/24.png)


Edit the code by replacing the decoded ``VDObjects.MapX`` with the encoded one, then run it to proceed to the second stage.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/25.png)


After beautifying and obfuscating the executable, we can now proceed to the second stage.

The function ``I8.yw(25500, I8.wJ)`` is a sleep function, so we can ignore it.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/26.png)


The malware attempts to load a resource called ``meBW`` in the first stage, and then checks if it is decoded or not.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/27.png)


Here malware convert variable bitmap to data and in ``tf.dr.tf(array, string_1)`` take it and the variable ``Ysjyb`` as arguments to decode the data which in array 

![](analysis/images%20agaent/28.png)


Now that it has been encoded, let's continue the investigation to learn more about it.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/29.png)


This function decompresses the content from ``array2``, saves it into ``array3``, and then checks if there's another executable in stage three. 

![](analysis/images%20agaent/30.png)


This function takes array3 as an argument and explores its contents to understand what happens inside.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/31.png)


Load this executable into memory.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/32.png)

Here is what was loaded.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/33.png)


It's weird because it takes the loaded executable as an argument, so we need to understand what it's doing there.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/34.png)


Summary: It simply calls back the function "hy" to invoke the main function in the executable.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/35.png)


The return value is saved in the variable ``obj``

![](analysis/images%20agaent/36.png)
Let's move on to stage three.

# Stage 3 :

<br>
This stage is obfuscated, so we will deobfuscate it using de4dot.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/37.png)


Now it's much better .

![](analysis/images%20agaent/38.png)


The malware tries to get a handle for itself.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/39.png)


Function ``smethod_3`` takes the handle from the same malware and returns its base address.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/40.png)


Here, the "if" statement checks for something, and if it's true, the malware performs some operations in the memory. We need to investigate these two functions further.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/41.png)


This function takes the handle of the malware to determine its full path.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/42.png)


The return value from `smethod_4` is ``<Unknown>``, which means it doesn't exist on the disk. This is true because stage three was loaded from stage two. Let's continue to figure out why the malware does this.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/43.png)


In this case, the malware returns the first character in the path, which explains why it checks if the whole path is equal to "<". It seems like the malware might be using this technique to evade malware analysts who try to dump it from stage two or to make analysis more difficult with its obfuscated form. Anyway, let's continue with our mission.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/44.png)


After performing some operations in this memory region, the malware proceeds to the second constructor 
(cctor).smethod_3` simply returns the assembly for the current executable.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/45.png)


Function `smethod_4` takes two arguments: the name of the resource to be loaded and the assembly for the malware

![](analysis/images%20agaent/46.png)


This function takes the resource name and resource manager and returns the object from this resource

![](analysis/images%20agaent/47.png)


``smethod_2`` calls ``smethod_7`` and ``smethod_8`` to initialize the decrypted key ``string_0``. After the XOR decryption, ``smethod_9`` returns the length of the decrypted data, and finally, this data is copied.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/48.png)


Finally, ``smethod_1`` takes the data from ``smethod_2`` and performs XOR encryption on this data using ``byte_0``.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/49.png)


Here is the executable (stage 4).

![](analysis/images%20agaent/50.png)


After decoding the executable, the malware assigns some values. We will find out their purpose later

![](analysis/images%20agaent/51.png)


In the main function, the malware first tries to get the path for the first stage. It's not clear why it does this, but we might find out later.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/52.png)


The malware performs various checks to deceive analysts, as it dynamically chooses the path it previously took during its execution.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/53.png)


In ``smethod_9``, there is a call to ``smethod_10``, which takes the same argument and then calls ``smethod_6``.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/54.png)


In ``smethod_10``, there are switch cases, and the malware dynamically determines which case to take, likely as a measure to deceive malware analysts.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/55.png)


``smethod_19`` returns the entry assembly of the first stage.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/56.png)


``smethod_20`` returns the path of the first stage.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/57.png)


The malware initiates the first call to CreateProcess with several parameters. The first one is the path of the first stage, the second one is the command that will be passed to the process, and the sixth one is a flag equal to 4. At this point, it appears that the malware is attempting to inject the first stage with the executable (stage 4) using a technique known as Process Hollowing.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/58.png)


``smethod_6`` in C takes the path of the first stage and two boolean arguments, then calls ``smethod_7`` with the same arguments.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/59.png)


Here, it tries to obtain the context of a specific thread.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/60.png)


It attempts to read some data from memory using specific parameters: the handle for a particular process (in this situation, it's for the same process), the base address, and the pointer to the buffer that receives the data.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/61.png)


Now, it calls ``VirtualAllocEx`` with important parameters: the handle for the process, the pointer specifying the starting address where the malware wants to allocate memory, and the protection set to ``PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE``.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/62.png)


The malware calls ``WriteProcessMemory`` to write some data into the target process. We need to know three parameters: the handle for the target process, the base address in the memory where the data will be written, and the buffer containing the data to be written. After this call, ``WriteProcessMemory`` is used in a for loop to repeatedly write data in the same region.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/63.png)


It tries to set a new context for the target thread and then calls ``ResumeThread`` to start the final stage.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/64.png)

When loading the final stage in Dnspy, it appears to be heavily obfuscated. To deobfuscate it, use de4dot.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/65.png)


Now it's much better .

![](analysis/images%20agaent/66.png)


When running malware in dnSpy, it triggers the first breakpoint in the static constructor .``cctor`` where it resolves some unknown operation. We want to understand what it does

![](analysis/images%20agaent/67.png)


When analyzing the code, if the variable is not resolved, the malware calls a function named ``smethod_0`` with three arguments to resolve it. The result of this resolution is then saved into ``Class0.string[X]``. Now, we need to figure out the significance and purpose of this operation

![](analysis/images%20agaent/68.png)


The function ``smethod_0`` belongs to ``Class0`` and it appears to decode some target bytes and convert them into a string based on the input provided to it. We need to investigate further to understand the exact process and its implications.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/69.png)


The array of numbers ``byte_0`` is passed to the function ``smethod_0`` to obtain the decoded target string, but only if it's the first time this specific string is being loaded.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/70.png)


This struct is responsible for decoding the bytes and returning the result.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/71.png)

### Decrypt Data :

To find out what is being decrypted, we can either modify the malware to decrypt the values itself or write a Python script to analyze and determine these values before beginning the analysis.
This Python script decodes the data.

This Python script decodes the data :

### Deobfuscate Resolve function :

These functions return the decrypted string, so we must replace each function call with its corresponding returned string.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/72.png)


To deobfuscate, we need to iterate through the tokens of the functions. The first function "A()" has a token of 0x0600022E, and the last function "hE()" has a token of 0x06000542.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/73.png)


This script iterates through the tokens :
```python
tokens = " ".join(["--strtok " + hex(i)[2:] for i in range(0x0600022E, 0x06000543)])
print(tokens)
 ```
 The Result

 ```
 Finally, we have clear and readable data.
<br>

 ### System info :
 The malware retrieves its name and ID and then creates a list of all processes with the same name. If any process has the same name as the malware, it will be terminated. This could be an anti-analysis technique or a form of mutex, but implemented differently.

 ![](analysis/images%20agaent/74.png)


 The malware gathers information about the system, such as the serial number.

  ![](analysis/images%20agaent/75.png)


  The malware also collects information about the processor. 

![](analysis/images%20agaent/76.png)


Network configurations

![](analysis/images%20agaent/77.png)


After collecting all the information, the malware decrypts it using MD5 hash.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/78.png)
<br>

### persistence :
The malware is attempting to determine whether these folders exist or not.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/79.png)


If the folders don't exist, the malware will attempt to create them.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/80.png)


Now we understand that the malware attempts to gather information and create specific folders to place itself in, establishing persistence.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/81.png)
<br>

### timers :
The malware sets two timers to repeatedly execute the two functions.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/82.png)


Upon receiving a command from the C2 (command and control) server, the malware will delete itself and terminate.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/83.png)


This code returns the path for ``Tor`` if it exists.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/84.png)


The code iterates through each process in the system and terminates any process with the name "tor" if it finds one.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/85.png)


In this code, ``text`` represents the URL that will be connected to in order to download HTML content. The variable ``test2`` is an expression that will be used later to extract links from the HTML. A ``regex ``object will be created from "test2." The variable ``text3`` will store the subpath of the Tor browser download URL, and ``text4`` will be used to store the downloaded HTML content.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/86.png)


This "foreach" loop iterates through the HTML content to search for links.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/87.png)


This code searches for a link in the new HTML content that contains ``tor-win32-`` and ends with ``.zip``. If it finds such a link, it returns the complete URL of the Tor browser download for Windows. If no suitable link is found, it returns a default URL.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/88.png)


The variable ``text`` holds the configuration settings for the Tor client. The code checks if Tor exists, and if not, it creates the ``Tor`` folder. It also checks if ``tor.zip`` exists or not. If ``tor.zip`` does not exist, it downloads it from the link ``hxxps://www.theonionrouter[.]com/dist.torproject[.]org/torbrowser/9.5.3/tor-win32-0.4.3.6[.]zip``.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/89.png)


The code checks if ``tor.zip`` exists. If it does, the malware opens a handle to read the data inside it. After reading, it extracts all files from ``tor.zip``. Then, the placeholder ``%tordir%`` is replaced with the path stored in variable "this.a", and ``%hash%`` is replaced with the result of calling a method "this.a``%torpass%"``" with the argument ``%torpass%``. Finally, the configuration is written to a file named ``torrc`` in the ``Tor`` folder.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/90.png)


The code attempts to create a process (tor.exe) without displaying a shell or window, making the process hidden. It waits for the process to reach the ``Bootstrapped 100%`` status, and then it returns the process ID.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/92.png)


The malware attempts to send data to the C2 (command and control) server using ``Tor``.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/93.png)


The code is responsible for moving the current malware executable to a temporary location with a unique file name.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/94.png)


The malware takes a screenshot of the infected system and sends it to the C2 server, but before sending, it encodes it using Base64.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/95.png)

```Hint : The purpose of these codes inside timers is to execute them at regular intervals repeatedly.```
<br>

### Public IP :

The code creates an object with the URL hxxps://api[.]ipify[.]org. If the connection is successful, it fetches the response data (responseStream) from this URL and returns it as a string. The response data represents the public IP address of the infected system.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/96.png)
<br>

### Cookies :

Agent Tesla is designed to collect browser cookies from different web browsers on the infected machine. These cookies are sent to the Command and Control (C2) server. This allows the attackers to search for sensitive information, like login credentials or valuable data stored in the cookies.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/b1.png)


The malware searches the cookies for login data.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/b2.png)


If the malware finds login data in the cookies, it saves it to send to the C2 server later.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/b3.png)


This function performs the search for login information and returns any data that is found.

![](analysis/images%20agaent/b4.png)
<br>

###  Stealing Browser Credentials :
The function searches in "profiles.init" to extract login files from it. and If it finds login files, the function tries to extract information from them .
